# Multiclass Detector 🧍🥖🍊🍏🍌

This program can recognise in real time five categories types of things, such as: person,bread,orange,apple and banana.

# Application 
This program can be implemented in agriculture to recognize fruits, but in addition to this, by recognizing people, it can also be used in the automotive industry, where autonomous cars can detect pedestrians.

# Difficulty
The main problem to develop the system was accessing the data set to train the artificial vision model, I did not have enough data to feed the model, but I solved it by accessing the Google site (Open Dataset Images), on this site I was able to download all the data sets I needed.
